# ProjectCapstoneFE

This is a front-end project for my capstone built using Angular CLI version 14.2.13. The application can be run by executing the command ng serve in the terminal, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:4200/.

To learn more about Angular CLI, you can use the command ng help or check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page

## Backend Link

You can access the backend project [here](https://github.com/FedeYozora/Project-Capstone-BE).

## Description

This is a webpage created for my uncle who is an artist specialised in sacred stained glasses, this webpage is a sort of online portfolio where he can add all his works and display them so anyone can see them, and eventually they can also add comments if they register.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
